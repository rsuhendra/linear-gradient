# Linear Gradient Project

## In this repository you'll find a range of scripts that can be used for tracking and analyzing fly navigation in the linear/shallow gradient behavioral assay.

The most important scripts are: 

*test_track.py*- in this script, the genotype/fly name is provided as d0-- hard coded in the script-- and tracking and plotting of the tracks is performed. 

*vectors_mod2.py* - a list of genotypes can be used here, returns both the radial frequency and speed plots. 

*dist_2_lines.py* - takes in a list of inputs-- see d0sgrp in the code-- and performs the appropriate statistical tests.
